# cTAKES-Biomedical-Documents-summarizer

A **clinical NLP toolkit** built for ontology-based and semantic-aware summarization of PubMed **biomedical articles** and **clinical case studies**. This system leverages medical concept extraction (via **cTAKES**) and semantic chaining (via **SpaCy vectors**) to produce interpretable summaries using **LexRank**.

This repository includes:
- A full **Tkinter-based GUI** for medical text exploration, parsing, entity recognition, and summarization
- Tools to analyze both **structured biomedical literature** and **narrative clinical notes**

---

##  Use Case

Designed for:
- NLP researchers working with **PubMed abstracts**, **PMC full-texts**, and **case study corpora**
- Medical informaticians needing interpretable summarization without neural models
- Developers integrating biomedical NLP with clinical entity frameworks like **UMLS**

---

## üí° Features

###  Ontology-Driven Summarization Pipeline
- Extracts relevant sentences using:
  - **cTAKES**: biomedical entities (Diseases, Procedures, Medications)
  - **SpaCy similarity chains**: selects semantically related sentences
- Summarization via **LexRank** applied to semantically ranked + concept-aware sentences
- Built-in tokenizer and filter for PubMed-style content

###  GUI (Tkinter): Clinical NLP Dashboard
- Load case reports or PubMed papers from file or web
- Run full **cTAKES Clinical Pipeline**
- Display parsed output, negation, polarity, and SRL
- Generate **summaries with biomedical context**
- Highlighted named entities in multi-color viewer
